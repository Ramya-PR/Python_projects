### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Because of the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, we will analyze U.S. bikeshare data to uncover bike share usage patterns between three large cities and calculate statistics to find popular times of travel, popular stations and trip, trip duration and user information.
Also, we need to build an interactive environment that takes in raw input from the user to answer questions about the dataset. There are four questions that will change the answers:
1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
3. (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
4. (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on which we will do data analysis.After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.

The script also prompts the user if they would like to see the raw data. If the user answers 'yes', then the script prints 5 rows of data at a time and then prompts the user if they would like to see 5 more rows of the data. The script will continue prompting and printing until the user chooses 'no', they do not want any more raw data to be displayed.
