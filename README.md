### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Understand U.S. bikeshare data to uncover bike share usage patterns between three large cities and calculate statistics to find popular times of travel, popular stations and trip, trip duration and user information.
Also, we need to build an interactive environment that takes in raw input from the user to answer questions about the dataset. There are four questions that will change the answers:
1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
3. (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
4. (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on which we will do data analysis.After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.
